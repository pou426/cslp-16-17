# check the kind of matrx in which the route planning algorithm will not work

# matrix with only one path in and one path out gives you a path between all pairs in the minimum distance matrix 

# each column needs to have at least one 'in' arc

# lower limition for maximum amount of -1's: to have a maximum number of -1's in the roadsLayout matrix and yet still be able to generate a complete graph after computing the shortest path algorithm, we need the elements above/below/left/right of the diagonal elements to be non -1.
